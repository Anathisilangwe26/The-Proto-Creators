What is a Motto?
******TO BE DELETED and replaced with MOTTO Phrase ---- A motto is a phrase that explains a brand's values by summarizing their core principles or beliefs. A motto is often what comes to mind first when people think about your brand or business.

Task 1

SDLC methodologies.
1. Waterfall model        : The earliest SDLC approach that was used for software development.
2. Agile                  : A project based on delivering recquirements iteratively and incrementally throughout the life cycle.
3. Scrum                  : A management framework that teams use to self-organise and work towards a common goal.


4. DSDM                   : An agile method that focuses on the full project lifecycle.
5. Lean                   : A concept that emphasizes optimizing efficiency and minimizing waste in the software development process. 
6.Rational unified process: A software development and project management process that provides a disciplined and methodical approach towards assigning tasks and responsibilities in a team


7.Feature Driven Development   : Is a customer-centric software development procedure known for short iterations and frequent releases and its purpose is to emphasize breaking down large projects into smaller , manageable steps and delivering them in quick repitition.
8.Joint Application Development: It is a methodology that involves the client or the end user in the design and development of a software application through a succession of collaborative workshops called JAD sessions in defining the business need and developing a solution based on that need.



TASK 2

Explaining briefly the different types of prototyping.

1. Throw-away Prototyping:     It is the procces of creating prototype versions of a product, building initial ideas for different applications, interfaces, or functions. these functions that are created do not neccesaruly have to be included in the finished system. Rather, the main purpse/idea is to collect feedback, prove concepts, or tackle other research tasks.

2. Evolutionary Prototyping:   It is the circuition model in which the system is developed in increments so that it can readily be modified in response to end user and customer feedback, the main intend is to implement external feedback, identifying new requirements and confirming compatibility as new recquirements are added. One of the main advantages of Evolutionary prototyping is that the delivery of the system is speeded up and the system is more likely to meet the uses requirements.

3.Incremental Prototyping:      It is the prototyping technique in which the various prototypes are eventually combined into a single product reducing the feedback time between the user and the application development team. These individual prototypes are evaluated and refined separately and individually they can be evaluated for consistency in look, feel, behavior, and terminology.

4.Extreme Prototyping:    It is the prototyping technique that breaks down web development into three phases, each of the phases are basesd on the preceding one.
                      Extreme protrotyping is conducted in three phases:
Phase 1: Build the HTML wireframes to stimulate the presentation layer. These web pages have limited interactivity. They are complete enough to show users the various user journeys through the application.
Phase 2: TRANSFORM the wireframes to fully functional HTML pages, tying them to a stimulated service layer.
Phase 3: CODE and implement the services layer.



TASK 3  : Three phototye fidility 

1. Low-fidelity prototype : A qiuck and easy way to translate high-level design concepts into tengible and testable artifacts.It is often refered as to the skeleton of the final design because it gives the designers or programmers the idea about the project. it includes visual design meaning some if the visual attributes are presented, it only include the important elements about the design and has interactivity.
         The advantages  : cheap and simple , very quick and easy to create, since it's collaborative mmore people can be involved in the process increasing group work.
       The Disadvantages : Due to the simplicity of the prototype, functionality cannot be tested ,  It also would be unclear to users during tests .Interactivity is  limited since there are no complex animations and transitions.
